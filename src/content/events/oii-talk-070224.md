Leiden HumAN researcher Justin Wang Ngai Yeung and Leiden Institute for Area Studies researcher Dr. Rizal Shidiq will present at the upcoming event at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) on their latest work Political Social Network in Indonesia (POLISONI).

### About the event
2024 is already promising to be an important year for elections, as over 40% of the worldâ€™s population will be eligible to vote. Digital technologies can impact campaigns, political participation, and elections in many ways. In the first event of the OII elections initiative, we would like to zoom in on the digital aspects of the Indonesian election. We will introduce the background of the Indonesian election and its importance and cover how digital media and technologies are being used by political actors. Additionally, we will discuss online content governance in the context of tensions and power negotiations involved in moderating political content. Relying on social data science approaches, we will present a database on Indonesian candidate profiles developed by researchers at Leiden University. Please join us for a discussion of the different digital aspects of the Indonesian election.
