        <text class="text-lg">On February 14, 2024, Indonesia will embark on a monumental democratic exercise, welcoming 205 million eligible voters to shape its future governance. With approximately 300,000 candidates competing for 20,614 political seats, the sheer scale of Indonesiaâ€™s general election calls for both local and global attention.
          <br></br>
          Our project, <strong>Political Social Networks in Indonesia</strong>, merges the intricate knowledge of Indonesiaâ€™s political economy with cutting-edge techniques in web scraping, social network analysis, and machine learning. This collaboration aims to democratise access to election data, opening new avenues for research into Indonesiaâ€™s political dynamics and democratic processes.
          <br></br>
          As we navigate through the complexities of collecting and analysing candidate profiles, we confront the challenges of data preservation in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Our initiative seeks to build a comprehensive data repository and pioneer a methodology that ensures the longevity and accessibility of election data for future explorations.
          <br></br>
          Join us as we delve into the heart of Indonesiaâ€™s political fabric, unravelling the threads that weave together its political, economic, and social narratives. Our journey is not just about capturing data; itâ€™s about fostering a deeper understanding of democracy in action and contributing to a more informed and engaged research community.
